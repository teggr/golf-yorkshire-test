      <p>Rather like the New Course at St Andrews and the Old Course at Ballyliffin,
  Prince's is sometimes overshadowed by its immediate neighbour, in this case
  Royal St. George's. As someone who has been visiting Prince's Golf Club for more
  than 30 years, I feel that rather than signature holes and face-value fun, the
  three loops of nine have real strength in depth and offer a golfing challenge
  equal to many of our finest links. And with recent changes and improvements to
  bunkering, fairways and run-off areas, it continues to grow.</p>

      <h2>The Welcome</h2>
        <p>The severity of the challenge ahead is apparent from the opening drive
        where you need to carry a bunker on the corner of the dogleg into the
        prevailing wind. There is then a long approach to a green with run-offs on
        both sides. These areas have been greatly improved in recent times leading
        to fair and consistent lies that offer hope of an up-and-down. Turning
        with the wind, the short second is far more welcoming, although the large
        green can lead to a challenge with the putter.</p>
        <p>A risk and reward long hole comes next, back into the wind and with an
        attractive, rumpled fairway. You will want to play to the left, away from
        out-of-bounds, but this brings two bunkers into play for the lay-up.</p>

      <h2>The 19th</h2>

    <p>Some people don't hold the Himalayas in such high regard as the other two
    nines, perhaps due to its less links-like opening, but I feel it provides a
    strong, welcome and very enjoyable contrast. It begins with two doglegs; the
    first gently left to right, the second much more of a handbrake turn to the
    left.</p>
